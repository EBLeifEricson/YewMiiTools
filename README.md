# YewMiiTools
Tool to help simplify conversion between 3DS/WiiU Mii and TLoZ:BoTW's UMii.

At the moment, there's still a few steps, but I plan to combine some of these steps to make it even easier. Also, I think I might be incorrectly converting the eye and eyebrow rotation values-- they don't seem to just directly copy over? If anyone can tell me how to convert them properly, please let me know.

**There are some cosmetic values that can crash the game due to not existing in BotW. I plan to account for this eventually, but if this occurs, try removing glasses, makeup, etc.**

## Usage
1. Place desired NPC .sbactorpack file(s) from extracted game files into the same folder as the tool. These can be found in /romfs/Actor/Pack/, see here for NPC names: https://gbatemp.net/threads/botw-item-names-for-pandaonsmacks-trainer.463959/
2. Place your **3DS/WiiU formatted** .mii file(s) into the same folder as the tool. (Right now, I use a jank method of copying the temp.mii file generated by this tool: https://gbatemp.net/threads/release-mii2studio-convert-any-mii-to-the-mii-studio-format-and-render-miis-as-pngs.575422/ If you know of a better way, *please* let me know.)
3. Run "yewmiiconv.exe" and select option 1 to extract all sbactorpack files.
4. Run the tools again. Select option 2 and follow the prompt to convert the Mii file(s) to UMii. First, drop the extracted NPC directory (or type/paste it in). Then, drop (or type/paste) the Mii file you wish to inject. 
5. The script should generate "FinalResult.bumii". This is the finished injected UMii.
6. Copy the FinalResult.bumii into the extracted NPC folder you wish to replace, and rename it to match the NPC's UMii file. (Example, /Npc_HatenoVillage001/Actor/UMii/Npc_HatenoVillage001.bumii)
7. Now select option 3 in the tool to rebuild the NPC folders. It will prompt you to specify whether you use the Wii U or Switch version format.
8. The script will generate "OriginalNPCName.out.sbactorpack". This is your final file that can be put back into the gamefiles or loaded with LayeredFS.

I originally wrote this as an exercise to read Mii files from scratch (without using any other code/libraries). The other conversion tasks for this project are achieved using external bundled tools though:
* BotWUnpacker by Shadsterwolf https://github.com/Shadsterwolf/BotWUnpacker
* BotW-aampTool by Zer0XoL https://github.com/Zer0XoL/BotW-aampTool

This is probably *far* from the most efficient way to do this conversion, but it works for my own purposes.
